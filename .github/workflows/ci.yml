    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code.
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up JDK 17. This is a common requirement for many Java projects.
      # Ensure this matches the project's intended Java version.
      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '17'
          distribution: 'temurin'
          cache: 'maven'

      # Step 3: Build the project using Maven.
      # This command compiles the code, runs tests (if configured in pom.xml), and packages the application.
      - name: Build with Maven
        run: mvn clean install -DskipTests

      # Step 4: Run unit tests.
      # This executes all tests defined in the project's test sources.
      - name: Run Unit Tests
        run: mvn test

      # Step 5: Upload test results (JUnit XML format) for better visibility in GitHub Actions.
      # This step helps in analyzing test outcomes directly from the GitHub UI.
      - name: Upload Test Results
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: always() # Upload artifacts even if previous steps failed.
        with:
          name: test-results
          path: target/surefire-reports/

      # Step 6: (Optional) Upload code coverage reports.
      # Requires code coverage tools (like JaCoCo) configured in pom.xml.
      # For this example, assuming JaCoCo is used.
      - name: Upload Code Coverage Report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: success() # Only upload if tests passed.
        with:
          name: code-coverage
          path: target/site/jacoco/

      # Step 7: (Optional) Publish code coverage to Codecov.
      # This step requires a Codecov token, typically set as a secret in repository settings.
      # - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
      #   uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
      #   with:
      #     token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
      #     directory: target/site/jacoco/

      # Step 8: Linting and Formatting Check (if integrated with Maven plugins like checkstyle or PMD).
      # Assumes Maven plugins are configured for static analysis.
      - name: Lint and Format Check
        run: mvn checkstyle:check pmd:check
        # If using a separate linter like PMD or Checkstyle, the command would be adjusted.
        # For example, if PMD is configured, you might run `mvn pmd:check`.
        # If Checkstyle is configured, you might run `mvn checkstyle:check`.
        # The above command assumes both are configured and need to run.
